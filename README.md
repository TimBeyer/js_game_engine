JS Game Engine
==============

I started building this engine in 2010 to learn Javascript.
The idea was being able to load game package definitions via JSON
and then have them pushed to the client via websockets.  
That way I was hoping I could build something that works well with
browser games and can be run on the server as well to prevent cheating.

Sadly, I never finished it because I ran into problems that - at the time - I could not solve.

It supports loading tilemaps, slicing them and setting up a 
basic renderer with input handling to display the tiles.

Now, that I have the skills to finish this, I'm lacking the time.
To be continued...
